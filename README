CddaX - CD Digital Audio eXtractor
==================================

CddaX is a tiny windows application to rip audio CDs.


Features
--------

* Encodes as MP3 or FLAC files
* Can rip hidden tracks
* Can load metadata and cover art from MusicBrainz


Runtime Requirements
--------------------

* Basic functionality: .NET 4.0 on Windows XP or higher
* MusicBrainz and High DPI support: .NET 4.8 on Windows 7 or higher

There is some experimental code to support Mono on Linux,
but I recommend you run it in wine with real .NET 4.8 installed.


How to build
------------

CddaX is built using Visual Studio 2010. There is a VS solution containing
the main app and the installer project inside the CddaX subdirectory.

LAME: use the VS command prompt, change to the 3rdparty/lame directory,
then run

    nmake -f Makefile.MSVC ASM=no MSVCVER=8.0

or

    nmake -f Makefile.MSVC ASM=no MSVCVER=Win64

and copy the resulting file to CddaX/CddaX/lame{64,}.exe

FLAC: create a new empty build directory somewhere and use cmake

    cmake path\to\CddaX\3rdparty\flac \
        -G "NMake Makefiles" \
        -DWITH_OGG=0 \
        -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

Then edit CMakeCache.txt and replace every occurence of "/MD" with "/MT".
After that, build it with nmake and copy the result from src/flac/flac.exe
to CddaX/CddaX/flac{64,}.exe
